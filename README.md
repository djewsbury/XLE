### XLE prototype 3D game engine

I've been making a lot of changes here lately; so any documentation is a little out of date. However I might occasionally post some updates at the development blog: https://djewsbury.github.io.

There's also some older technical documentation (though it's quite a bit out of date): https://github.com/xlgames-inc/XLE/wiki
